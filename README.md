to open and execute your code without any modificaƟon to it, for the OUTPUT of the
code when run using the Visual Studio Code environment. Name your file folder with
your FULL NAME AND ASSIGNMENT NUMBER. For example: AHMAD_NAZRI_ASG6.
ii. PDF file. In this file, you have to create a file that contains all the C++ code (.h and .cpp)
and the screenshot of the OUTPUT. Name it with your FULL NAME AND ASSIGNMENT
NUMBER. For example: AHMAD_NAZRI_ASG6.PDF
